<blockquote><em>
Software conflicts arising because of conflicting changes are a regular occurrence 
and delay projects. The main precept of workspace awareness tools has been to 
identify potential conflicts early, while changes are still small and easier to 
resolve. However, in this approach conflicts still occur and require developer 
time and effort to resolve. We present a novel conflict minimization technique 
that proactively identifies potential conflicts, encodes them as constraints, and 
solves the constraint space to recommend a set of conflict-minimal development 
paths for the team. Here we present a study of four open source projects to 
characterize the distribution of conflicts and their resolution efforts. We then 
explain our conflict minimization technique and the design and implementation of 
this technique in our prototype, Cassandra. We show that Cassandra would have 
successfully avoided a majority of conflicts in the four open source test subjects. 
We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach by applying the technique to a 
simulated set of scenarios with higher than normal incidence of conflicts.

<p>
To help limit conflicts caused by collaborative software development,
researchers Kasi and Sarma decided on a <i>Prevention is better than cure</i> 
approach. Why?
</p>
<p>
In an initial study of four open source projects from GitHub (Perl, Storm, 
Jenkins, and Voldemort) the authors found that merge conflicts ranged from 
7.6% to 19.3%. Of the clean merges, 2.1% to 14.7% had build failures and 5.6% to 
35% of correct builds incurred test failures. Also,
each project had different distributions of different types of conflicts and 
different resolution times for each conflict type.
</p>
<p>Two main conclusions from this work are:
<ol>
<li><i>Conflicts are the norm rather than the exception</i>. Kasi and Sarma
report that this is the case no matter the size of the project (KLOC) or the
number of developers involved. This provides an explanation as to why this norm 
exists in open projects where the majority of work is done by a small core group.
</li>
<br>
<li><i>There is no one-size-fits-all conflict mitigation technique</i>. This
conclusion is due to the large variances in the results in terms of types and 
number of conflicts which also varied with resolution times.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Kasi and Sarma's proactive approach resulted in task scheduling tool for 
conflict minimization that was effective by avoiding the majority of conflicts 
from their experiments.
Considering that the conflict resolution times in their study spanned multiple 
days, ranging from an average of 6 to 23 days, Kasi and Sarma's work adds another
dimension to research in the area conflicting changes parallel software 
development. This work addresses the premise that,
<b>less conflicts = less time spent on conflict resolution.</b>
